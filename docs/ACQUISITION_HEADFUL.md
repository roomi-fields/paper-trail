# Where to run browser-based acquisition (`annas_headful` source)

Short answer: **in any headless container**, provided you install a
*virtual display* in it. No desktop machine, no physical screen and no
graphical user session are required.

## The counter-intuitive part

Chromium's "headless" mode **does not work** for this source, even though
it does clear the anti-bot challenge:

| Step | headless | headful under Xvfb |
|---|---|---|
| `/scidb/` or `/md5/` page (DDoS-Guard) | ✅ passes | ✅ passes |
| Partner link obtained | ✅ | ✅ |
| **File download** | ❌ consistent **502** | ✅ **valid PDF** |

It is the *partner file server* that refuses, not the site itself. So a
genuinely windowed browser is needed — but the window can live in an
in-memory framebuffer (Xvfb): invisible, and with no graphics hardware.

## Container recipe (Debian/Ubuntu)

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
      xvfb \
      libnss3 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libcups2 libdrm2 \
      libxkbcommon0 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxfixes3 libxrandr2 \
      libgbm1 libasound2 fonts-liberation \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip install playwright && playwright install chromium
```

System package names drift between distribution releases (`libasound2`
became `libasound2t64` on recent ones). To avoid tracking those renames,
let Playwright install what the browser needs itself — only `xvfb` is then
left to add by hand:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends xvfb \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN pip install playwright && playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

Launch (a weekly acquisition job, for instance):

```bash
RESEARCH_ENABLE_SHADOW_LIBS=1 \
xvfb-run -a --server-args="-screen 0 1400x1000x24" \
    python -m pipeline run --loop
```

**`RESEARCH_ENABLE_SHADOW_LIBS=1` is not optional**: without it, neither
this source nor the other extended sources enter the cascade — the job runs
without error and never uses the browser. See `DISCLAIMER.md` for what that
activation commits you to.

`xvfb-run -a` picks a free display number, so several jobs can coexist
without stepping on each other.

`--retry-exhausted` (see below) is deliberately absent from this command:
it is a one-off gesture, not a scheduling setting.

## Things to watch for in a container

- **`--no-sandbox`** is already passed by the source (required for Chromium
  in an unprivileged container).
- **`/dev/shm`**: Docker allocates 64 MB by default, which crashes Chromium
  on heavy pages. Run with `--shm-size=1g`.
- **Memory**: budget ~500 MB for Chromium + Xvfb on top of the pipeline.
- **Duration**: "slow download" slots impose roughly twenty seconds of
  waiting per attempt, and the source tries four slots per mirror. Count
  ~2 min per reference in the favourable case, but up to the per-reference
  budget when slots are saturated: `RESEARCH_ANNAS_HEADFUL_BUDGET_S`,
  **600 s by default**. Size the scheduled job's timeout on that budget
  times the number of refs likely to reach this source — not on the 2 min.
- **Slot rationing**: past a few dozen files per session, slots get scarce.
  A reference that only hit transient unavailability is not locked: it gets
  a retry date (15 min on the first failure, doubling each time, capped at
  8 h) and the pipeline skips it until then. So it does not resume on the
  next pass, but on the first pass after that date — hence the value of a
  recurring schedule over a single run.
- **`--retry-exhausted`** lifts the automatically-placed cascade exhaustion
  locks so the affected references are retried. Keep it for one-off
  resumptions — after adding a source, for example. In a recurring job it
  replays the full cascade, on every run, over references whose exhaustion
  has already been established; locks placed by a human are left untouched.
- **Quick environment check.** From the plugin root (no environment
  variable is needed for this check alone):

```bash
xvfb-run -a python -c "from lib.shadow.annas_headful import available; print(available())"
# expected:            (True, 'ok')
# without a display:   (False, 'no_display_run_under_xvfb')
# without Playwright:  (False, 'playwright_not_installed')
```

With neither display nor Playwright, the source simply declares itself
unavailable and the cascade carries on without it: the pipeline stays
functional, it just loses that one source.

## Alternative without a graphical container

If operational policy forbids installing a browser in production,
acquisition can run elsewhere (workstation, admin machine, dedicated
container) against the **same shared registry**: the source writes PDFs to
`RESEARCH_SOURCES_PATH` and updates the reference records. Production then
only has to read the registry.
